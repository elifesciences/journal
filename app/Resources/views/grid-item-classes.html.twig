{#
This determines which grid classes to apply, depending on whether there is anything to display
in the secondary column of content, and whether there is a viewSelector.

In all cases, when the viewport is smaller than large: viewSelector, main, and secondary columns are all full width.

The viewSelector is only not full width at x-large width, where it is 2 col

What follows describes when the viewport is large or x-large. There is always a main column of content, there may also
be a viewSelector and related content, respectively.


3 columns - related and viewSelector
LG:
    viewSelector 12 col,
    main 8 col, related 4 col

XL: viewSelector 2 col,
    main 7 col, related 3 col


2 columns - related, no viewSelector

LG:
    main 8 col, related 4 col
XL:
    main 7 col (push 2), related 3 col


2 columns - viewSelector, no related

LG:
    viewSelector 12 col,
    main 10 (push 1)

XL: viewSelector 2 col,
    main 8 col (push 0)


1 column - no related, no jump

LG: main 10 (push 1)
XL: main 8 col (push 2)
