I will make a few proposals in this currently empty PR to see what you like.

## Hackability of the project: high

See https://testing.googleblog.com/2016/08/hackable-projects.html

- performance: top-notch, total of 20 seconds for static analysis, PHPUnit and Beat
- reproducibility: good, runs on the local VM and CI without issues
- flakiness: none, even the few Selenium ones run quickly and reliably
- (code) coverage: high, more than 90% for most of the areas just with the PHPUnit test suite, the wiring is/will be covered elsewhere like in `end2end` tests.

Compare running tests for a project like the bot, which can't completely run locally. Not much to do here.

## Test suite- verbosity: high

[ ] Some personas for reusable data can help, see http://dev9.com/article/2014/7/smarter-acceptance-testing-with-personas

Rationale:

- given that there are many standard types that can be composed into a response e.g. podcast and article snippets appearing in collections, persons
- since mocked responses make up a large part of the *ControllerTest files
- and ControllerTest make up a large part of the test code

[ ] Some Page Objects may help concentrating the CSS selector in one point, see http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html

Rationale:
- especially for some generic parts like '.content-header__title' that can be inherited or composed with traits
- as PHPUnit does not force separation of specification and automation like Behat, infrastructural code may get mixed up with the test-as-documentation

## Behat 

The size of the contexts is large but not unwieldy yet. Here most of the code is made up of stubs too, which are dynamically generated however, probably just because of their size. The separation into content areas helps keeping the state space small.

The .features files are clear enough, there could probably be a layer introduced in the future between Context objects and the underlying simulated browsers (different Page Objects or utilities like classes implementing the logic now kept in the base Context).

One thing that would be very interesting to capture would be reasons, e.g.
```
  - Abstract, digest and first body section are open, the rest closed
```
turning into
```
  - Abstract, digest and first body section are open, the rest closed (allow the user to immediately see the important things, do not create an endless scrollbar)
```
This helps a lot when decisions need to be revisited in the future. In fact there are a few unused `As a ...` that serve this purpose. No action yet on this point.

## Controller layer

[ ] We may need to create some abstraction to reduce the boilerplate inside the *Controller.php files

I'll take for granted the user of api-sdk over api-client to reduce the amount of data processing and the integration problems.

It seems the complexity starts to become too much when a single action method leads to 50-70 lines. I'll start from MagazineController and then ArticlesController to check which repeatable patterns are appearing in the code.
